How to represent Time traditionally?
1.	Minutes/Quarter/Half (To/Past)  Hour
      Example:
      five past three (3.05)

2.	Hour : Minute
      a)	Hour Minute (am or pm)
      Example:
      Three ten
      3:10
      4:05 pm

3.	Hour
      a)	Hour am or pm
      b)	Hour o’clock
      Example:
      6 am
      6 o’clock

4.	Key word
      a)	Midnight (0:00)
      b)	Noon / Midday (12:00)

The idea behind calculating relative time
Like Water (H2O) is made up of 2 H, and 1 O. We get relative time by firstly getting/recognize fixed Time Unit and then based on keyword(after/from),we calculate relative time.
1. Define Time Unit.
Possible Time Unit.(See Time Class)
-  number (Possible Time)
-  specific time (Ambiguity/ without Ambiguity)
-  duration of time
-  ampm (ampm and ampm intention)
Intuitively,The program has 3 basic steps.To easily program, we have four rounds.
- Round 1 and 2, Extract Time Units,including Number(Possible Time), specific time,duration of time, and ampm
- Round 3, Based on keyword such as prior to, Calculate relative Time
- Round 4, Based on ampm Intention resolve possible ambiguity
